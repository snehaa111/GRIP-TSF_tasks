## Data Science & Business Analytics Tasks
This repository consist of the tasks given during my internship at The Sparks Foundation.


## Task 1 - Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning
In this task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

## Task 3 - Exploratory Data Analysis-Retail
Here we have to perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset 'SampleSuperstore'
We have to find out the weak areas where we can work as a manager to make profits.
So after analysis these were some areas where we can make profit: 
1-) We can limit sales of furniture and increase that of technology.
2-) We can increase sales in east as the profit is more their.
3-) We should concentrate more on states like 'New York' and 'California' to make more profits.
